    <h2>Questions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><b>How were we supposed to use modules in the group project?</b> The group project instructed us to. We were never able to get that functionality to work at all. And when I looked it up, it said "Modules work only via HTTP(s), no locally". It said that you can't use import/export directives locally and that to solve this, we would need to spin up our site as a server.  See this <a href="https://javascript.info/modules-intro#what-is-a-module">link</a>.  We wasted a lot of time trying to get the modules working and weren't able to.</li>
        <li><b>How do I use a self-invoking function?</b>  I wrapped all my js code in main.js in the self invoking function as recommended but then when I added a button to call a function, I couldn't figure out how to make the button onclick call "see" the function.  I had to commend out the self-invoking function to get it to work.</li>
