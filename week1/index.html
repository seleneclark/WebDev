        <li>This week was all about getting set up and selecting the software that I wanted to use for this class. 
        </li><li>I decided to use Brackets for my editor because I liked what it said about being designed specifically for

        </li><li><strike>I was hoping for a better debugger experience, but so far I haven't been able to see
