    <h1>Week 1 Page</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>This week was all about getting set up and selecting the software that I wanted to use for this class. 
        </li>
        <li>I decided to use Brackets for my editor because I liked what it said about being designed specifically for
        web development.  I was hoping for a better debugger experience, but so far I haven't been able to see 
        any console.log statements so that's a bit concerning. </li>
